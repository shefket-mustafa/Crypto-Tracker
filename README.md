## 🧠 About the Template

This project was scaffolded using **Lovable App's AI Builder**, which generates a professional React + TS setup out of the box. While the base structure and UI are pre-built, i will
:
- Add my own **business logic**
- Connect to **crypto APIs** or external data sources
- Implement authentication, user dashboards, and more
